I am a second-year masters student studying the [Parisian Master of Research in
Computer Science (MPRI)][mpri] at [*École Polytechnique*][x]. My research
interests lie in logic, verified proofs, and proof assistants (such as
[Coq][coq]).

In my Masters Year 1 internship, I worked towards formalising the guard checker of Coq with [Yannick Forster](https://yforster.de/)
in the [Cambium](https://cambium.inria.fr/) research team in Inria Paris.
In my [report](files/240827-report.pdf),
I documented the guard checker with examples and explanations.
The full [implementation](https://github.com/inria-cambium/m1-tan)
is freely accessible online.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science
at the [National University of Singapore][nus]. I wrote my [thesis](#thesis) on
the formalization of Coq Modules in the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/)
project, co-supervised by Nicolas Tabareau, Martin Henz, and Yue Yang. I was
also part of the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/),
the honors college of [NUS][nus].
