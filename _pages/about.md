I am a PhD student at [DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/),
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/), Belgium,
working with 
[Dominique Devriese](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/DominiqueDevriese)
and [Andreas Nuyts](https://anuyts.github.io/)
on implementing Multimodal Type Theory in Agda.
My research interests lie in logic, verified proofs,
and proof assistants (such as [Rocq][rocq]
and [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php)).

Previously in 2025,
I obtained the [Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science (MPRI)][mpri]
at [*École Polytechnique*][x].
In my Masters Year 2 internship,
I worked towards implementing computational UIP in Cubical Agda
([report](files/250820-m2-thesis.pdf), [code](https://swampertx.github.io/hset-cubical/Everything.html))
with
[Dominique Devriese](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/DominiqueDevriese)
and [Andreas Nuyts](https://anuyts.github.io/).
In my Masters Year 1 internship,
I worked towards formalising the guard checker of Rocq
([report](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04983786),
[code](https://github.com/inria-cambium/m1-tan))
with [Yannick Forster](https://yforster.de/)
in the [Cambium](https://cambium.inria.fr/) research team in Inria Paris.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science
at the [National University of Singapore][nus].
I wrote my [thesis](#theses) on
the formalization of Rocq Modules in the [MetaRocq](https://metarocq.github.io/) project,
co-supervised by [Nicolas Tabareau](https://tabareau.fr),
[Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/),
and [Yue Yang](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/463-yue-yang).
I was also part of the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/),
the honours college of [NUS][nus].

If you are interested in my research, looking for collaboration,
or having any questions about getting into type theory research (MPRI, etc),
please do not hesitate to get in touch with me!
