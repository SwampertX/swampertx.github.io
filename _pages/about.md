I am a second-year Masters (M2) student
studying the [Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science (MPRI)][mpri]
at [*École Polytechnique*][x].
My research interests lie in logic, verified proofs,
and proof assistants (such as [Rocq][rocq]
and [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php)).

In my Masters Year 1 internship,
I worked towards formalising the guard checker of Rocq
with [Yannick Forster](https://yforster.de/)
in the [Cambium](https://cambium.inria.fr/) research team in Inria Paris.
In my [report](files/240827-report.pdf),
I documented the guard checker with examples and explanations.
The full [implementation](https://github.com/inria-cambium/m1-tan)
is freely accessible online.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science
at the [National University of Singapore][nus].
I wrote my [thesis](#theses) on
the formalization of Rocq Modules in the [MetaRocq](https://metarocq.github.io/) project,
co-supervised by [Nicolas Tabareau](https://tabareau.fr),
[Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/),
and [Yue Yang](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/463-yue-yang).
I was also part of the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/),
the honors college of [NUS][nus].
