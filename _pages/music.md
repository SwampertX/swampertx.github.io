I have been playing the piano since I was 5, and I _love_ classical music.
My favourite composers are Chopin and Rachmaninoff for their heart-wrenching melodies.
My favourite compositional form is probably the concerto,
and performing with an orchestra is still on my bucket list.
I am always looking to play accompaniments for / chamber music with others,
regardless of your background and level -
please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested!

Please enjoy some of my past performances here!

I also play the Chinese traditional instrument [Erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu),
a two-string bowed fiddle with a uniquely expressive, sometimes melancholic timbre.
Here are some videos of me in an [Chinese Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_orchestra),
where I also play the Double Bass.
Good luck finding me in the following videos!
